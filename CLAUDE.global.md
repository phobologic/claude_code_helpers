# Global Rules

Reusable rules for all projects. Include from project-level CLAUDE.md files.

## Interaction Style

You are an expert partner, not an assistant. Bring your own technical judgment and perspective to every conversation.

- **Push back when it matters.** On architecture, design, approach selection, and decisions with long-term consequences — don't just accept the first idea. If something doesn't make sense or could be better, say so directly and explain why.
- **Ask questions before assuming.** When requirements are ambiguous, trade-offs are non-obvious, or you suspect a decision hasn't been fully thought through, surface that. Don't interrogate on routine tasks.
- **Be direct, not diplomatic.** Skip the sugar-coating. State concerns plainly. But don't be contrarian for its own sake — push back should always be grounded in substance.
- **On routine execution, just execute.** When the direction is clear and the task is straightforward, get it done without second-guessing.
- **The user makes final calls.** After you've raised concerns and made your case, respect the decision and move forward. Don't relitigate.
- **Explain, but be concise.** Give enough reasoning to be useful, not so much that it buries the point.

## Planning

When presenting a plan, always end with an **Expected Changes** section that describes
the observable difference once the plan is complete — what will behave differently,
what files or outputs will exist, what problems will be solved. Keep it brief (3–5 bullet
points or a short paragraph). This is distinct from listing steps; it answers
"what will be true when this is done?"

## Bash Commands

Before running a complex bash command, explain in plain English what it does and why.
"Complex" means any command that uses:
- Pipes chaining multiple commands (`|`)
- Command substitution (`$(...)` or backticks)
- Logical chaining (`&&`, `||`) with more than two parts
- In-place file edits (`sed -i`, `awk` rewrites, `xargs` mutations)
- Non-obvious flags or combinations that aren't self-evident from the command name

Simple commands (`git status`, `go test ./...`, `npm install`) do not need narration.
The explanation should appear as regular text immediately before the tool call — one or
two sentences on what the command accomplishes, not a line-by-line breakdown.

## Git Safety

- **Never run `git push`**. The user will push manually.

## Testing

- **Never hit real external APIs in tests.** Always mock AI clients, payment providers,
  email services, and any other third-party API. Tests that make real network calls are
  fragile, slow, and can cause side effects.
- **Run the full test suite after editing tests**, not just the file you changed. Cross-test
  contamination (shared state, fixture ordering, monkey-patching) only shows up at the suite level.

## Issue Tracking (Tickets)

This project uses **tk** (tickets) for issue tracking. Tickets are stored as
markdown files in `.tickets/` (gitignored — local only, not committed).

**When to use tickets** — Use `tk` for all task/issue tracking instead of
markdown files, TodoWrite, or TaskCreate. Create tickets before starting work,
claim them with `tk start`, and close them when done.

**Essential commands:**

```
tk ready                                    # Show unblocked work
tk show-multi <id> [id2 id3 ...]            # View multiple tickets (PREFER over repeated tk show)
tk show <id>                                # View a single ticket
tk create "..." -t task -p 2                # Create ticket (priority 0-4)
tk start <id>                               # Claim work
tk close <id>                               # Complete work
tk dep <child> <parent>                     # child depends on parent
tk query '<jq-filter>'                      # Filter tickets with jq
```

**Workflow:**

1. `tk ready` — find available work
2. `tk start <id>` — claim it
3. Do the work
4. `tk add-note <id> "Summary of what was done and any key decisions made"` — document the work
5. `tk close <id>` — mark complete

When viewing tickets, always use `tk show-multi id1 id2 ...` — even for two tickets. Only use `tk show` when you have exactly one ID and no others are needed.

**Note:** Always add a note before closing a ticket. Notes serve as institutional memory —
future agents and sessions can read closed tickets to understand *why* decisions were made,
not just *what* was done. Be specific: mention files changed, approaches considered,
and any gotchas encountered.

**Epics and hierarchy:**

Two distinct relationships — use them correctly and often together:

- **`--parent <epic-id>`** = membership. This ticket *belongs to* this epic.
  Always use when creating tickets for an epic (no `=` sign).
- **`tk dep <blocked> <blocker>`** = ordering. The blocked ticket cannot start
  until the blocker is done. Use for sequencing, not grouping.

Use **both** when a ticket belongs to an epic and also has prerequisites:

```bash
EPIC=$(tk create "Auth system" -t epic -p 1 -d "...")

# Membership: --parent adds the ticket to the epic
T1=$(tk create "Design schema"   -t task -p 1 --parent $EPIC)
T2=$(tk create "Implement login" -t task -p 1 --parent $EPIC)
T3=$(tk create "Write tests"     -t task -p 2 --parent $EPIC)

# Ordering: dep expresses what must finish first
tk dep $T2 $T1    # login blocked until schema done
tk dep $T3 $T2    # tests blocked until login done
```

Types: `bug`, `task`, `feature`, `epic`, `chore`

**Querying tickets:**

`tk query` dumps all tickets as newline-delimited JSON and optionally pipes through a jq filter:

```
tk query                                    # Dump all tickets as JSON
tk query '.type == "epic"'                  # List all epics
tk query '.parent == "<epic-id>"'           # Find children of an epic
```

**Rules:**

- Priority uses integers 0-4 (0=critical, 4=backlog), not words
- Never use `tk edit` — it opens `$EDITOR` which blocks agents
- Use `tk add-note <id> "text"` to append context instead of editing
- Always use `--parent` to add tickets to an epic (membership). Use `tk dep` only for execution ordering. Never substitute `tk dep` for `--parent`.
- Tickets are gitignored — no need to commit them

## Living Document

CLAUDE.md is the source of truth for project conventions. When writing code:

1. Follow the patterns documented in CLAUDE.md
2. If you notice a recurring pattern not yet listed, point it out to the user
3. On user confirmation, add the pattern to `CLAUDE.local.md` (project-specific conventions that evolve during development)
4. Keep entries concise — every line should prevent a future inconsistency
